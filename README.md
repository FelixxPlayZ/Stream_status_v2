This code help you to put streaming status in your discord account | By FelixPlayZ

Take out your token of your account 
Then put it in .env or secrets in Replit (if u put it anywhere except .env and secrets i will not be responsible)

Then put what u want to show as streaming 
Put the twitch live status (Not neccsary) 

Just Run the repl 
It will show error in red words but ignore that 
Now your account status will be streaming twitch
